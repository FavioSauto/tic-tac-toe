# Tic Tac Toe

This first version shows a basic game of Tic Tac Toe
it's dependency free, and made only with CSS3, HTML5
and Javascript.

The following steps for this project is to add new
game modes, like a new game with different symbol
sizes that could "eat" smaller symbols of your rival.

## Game mode by sizes
You can now play by symbol sizes and your rivals smaller
symbol. Right now you can play this game mode by branching
to the "bySizes" branch. Enjoy! :)
